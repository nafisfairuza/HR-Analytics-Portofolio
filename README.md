1. Employee Attrition

Queries & Insights:

attrition_rate.sql - Calculates the overall employee attrition rate.

high_turnover_departments.sql - Identifies departments with the highest resignation rates.

resignation_factors.sql - Analyzes key factors influencing employee resignations.

2. Salary Equity

Queries & Insights:

avg_salary_per_role.sql - Computes the average salary for each job role.

gender_pay_gap.sql - Compares average salaries between male and female employees.

salary_distribution_quartiles.sql - Analyzes salary distribution across different quartiles.

3. Workforce Productivity & Overtime Impact

Queries & Insights:

overtime_salary_comparison.sql - Shows that employees working overtime have higher salaries.

overtime_satisfaction_analysis.sql - Finds that overtime employees report slightly higher satisfaction.

overtime_resignation_rate.sql - Reveals that employees who work overtime have a higher resignation rate despite higher satisfaction.

Key Insight:

Even though employees who work overtime earn more and report higher satisfaction, they still tend to resign more frequently. This suggests that salary and job satisfaction alone might not be sufficient to retain employees. Work-life balance and long-term career growth could be other influential factors.

Conclusion

This HR analytics portfolio provides data-driven insights into employee attrition, salary equity, and productivity. The queries and analyses can help organizations make informed decisions to improve workforce retention and efficiency.

ðŸ“Œ Next Steps:

Further investigate the reasons behind high resignation rates for employees with high satisfaction.

Explore other factors such as work-life balance, promotion opportunities, and managerial support.

Optimize HR policies to enhance employee retention.
